# Project 2 

Upload all the required files for this project *as well as your own Makefile*.

The autograder will use your Makefile to build your programs, it will then create the required named pipes, and run all the tests.

Please do not use your repository to test your code. If tests reveal bugs, debug and test your changes locally before pushing updates.
