# Project 2 

**Enter your student number here:**

Upload the required files for the project to this repository. **You must upload your own Makefile.**

The autograder will use your Makefile to build your programs, it will then create the required named pipes, and run all the tests.

Please do not use this repository to test your code. If tests reveal bugs, debug and test your changes locally before pushing updates.

Do not change the contents of run_test.sh, classroom.yml or any of the expected output files or your tests will fail.
